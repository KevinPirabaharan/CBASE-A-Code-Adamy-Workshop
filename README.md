# **CBASE A-Code-Adamy Workshop**
*****************


This is a repository related to a workshop that was ran for University of Guelph's John F. Wood Centre (formerly known as the Centre for Business and Student Enterprise). The workshop was designed to introduce students from various backgrounds (mainly commerce) to programming and the applications it can have on other aspects.

Students were taught Python and ultimately created a simple calculator application through the Command Line Interface.
